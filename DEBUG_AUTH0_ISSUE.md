# üîß Auth0 Variables Set But Not Working - Debug Guide

## Environment Variables ‚úÖ

You have all the required variables:
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN`: face2face2.eu.auth0.com
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: dDyY4k8dK8iYbHjiKWMEHbJqoO96iFgQ
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`: [set]
- `AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL`: https://face2face-wq5b.onrender.com/auth/callback

**These look correct!** ‚úÖ

## Possible Issues

Since the variables are set, the problem is likely in **Auth0 Dashboard configuration**:

2. Applications ‚Üí Applications ‚Üí [Your App]

4. **"Allowed Callback URLs"** must have EXACTLY:
   ```
   https://face2face-wq5b.onrender.com/auth/callback
   ```
   
**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Missing `/auth/callback` at the end
- ‚ùå Using `http://` instead of `https://`

```

### üî¥ Issue 4: Application Type Wrong

In Auth0 Application Settings:

- NOT "Single Page Application"
- NOT "Native"

## üìä Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Render Logs

1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí **Logs**
2. Look for when the app starts, you should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Auth0 configured - Google login enabled
   ```
3. If you see warnings about missing variables, the variables aren't being loaded

### Step 2: Test the Auth0 Route

Try opening this URL directly:
```
https://face2face-wq5b.onrender.com/auth/auth0
```

**What happens?**

‚úÖ **Redirects to Auth0 login page** ‚Üí Auth0 connection works!

## üéØ Most Likely Fix

Based on experience, **90% of the time** when variables are set but login doesn't work, it's because:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Application is NOT connected to the Google Social Connection

**Fix it:**
1. Auth0 Dashboard ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **Social**
2. Click on **Google** (or create if it doesn't exist)
3. Click **"Applications"** tab at the top
4. Find your application in the list
5. **Enable the toggle** next to your app
6. Click **"Save"**

## üîç What Error Are You Seeing?

**A)** Nothing happens / page just reloads
**B)** Redirects to error page with message
**C)** Redirects to Google, but then error after selecting account
**D)** Infinite redirect loop
**E)** Other (describe it)

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Recreate the Callback URL variable
Sometimes Render has issues with environment variables.

1. In Render, **delete** `AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL`
2. Add it again: `https://face2face-wq5b.onrender.com/auth/callback`
3. Save and redeploy

### Fix 2: Check Auth0 Application is Active

2. At the top, check if application status is **"Active"** (not "Disabled")

### Fix 3: Verify Google Connection uses correct credentials
1. Auth0 Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Social ‚Üí Google
2. Check if you're using:
   - **Auth0 Developer Keys** (easier, but shows "Auth0" in consent screen)
   - **Own Google OAuth Client** (requires Google Cloud Console setup)
3. If using own credentials, verify they're correct
